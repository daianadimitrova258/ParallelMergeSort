# ParallelMergeSort
The program presents the way in which parallel merge sort works step by step. It is made through Visual Studio and is a Windows desktop project.

When the application is started, the following window appears. It gives 2 options to the users:
1. To go directly to the visualization of the algorithm for parallel merge sort.
2. First to familiarize themselves with the ordinary merge sort and then to understand how the parallel works.

If the user clicks the button "Визуализация", the description of the ordinary merge sort will be displayed. A window will appear in which the user can enter numbers in any order, separated by commas. The program will execute by pressing the button "Сортирай". This is what the screen looks like since all the threads have finished and the program has stopped.
